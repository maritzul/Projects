    <string name="article_text">So, we will be talking about titles. Just the word \'title\' in different languages, to be exact.
                                \n
                                \nIn Indonesian, title is <i>Judul</i>. How you read it is like <i>joodool</i>. Kurang lebih. Next, in Korean
                                title is <i>표제</i> or you read it like <i>pyonjae</i>. In German, <i>Titel</i> is title, you read it like title
                                but with so much German pronunciation. If you want to know title in more languages, you can open www.translate.google.com.</string>
